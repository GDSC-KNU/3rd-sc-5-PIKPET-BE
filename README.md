## 1. Introduction 
 More than 90 percent of dogs distributed in Korea are commonly known as **`pet shops`**. These pet shops are closely linked to illegal organizations, so-called **`pet factories`**. 

 Some people trying to maximize the benefits of buying and selling living things for money are building/operating poor infrastructure.

 **`Breeders/shelters`**, which should be an alternative to pet shops, are far from the center of the city, and are not accessible in many ways because they have different rules due to the absence of law.

 We tried to solve the problem by establishing an infrastructure that allows easy contact with street dog shelters/briders.
